# An Interactive Visual Analytics System for Precipitation Data Analysis


An Interactive Visual Analytics System for Precipitation Data Analysis is designed to support detailed analysis of identifying storm intensity, duration, and frequency. In addition, it can detect precipitation trends and possible anomalous precipitation events. Because of these multiple features, the system may provide critical information for designing efficient drainage systems, supporting flood forecasting, and informing hydrologic modeling through detailed precipitation analysis. It also allows users to download precipitation data for further analysis. To determine the usefulness of the system, we performed case studies demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting interactive precipitation data analysis, enabling precise characterization of precipitation patterns, and supporting evidence-based decision-making for infrastructure design, emergency management, and climate adaptation strategies.


The system is designed as an online system using PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
To run the system, you need to use either PHPStorm by JetBrains or PHPDesktop (https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop). If you want, you can set up a server environment yourself with a PHP interpreter. 

You must use the dataset from https://zenodo.org/records/15114251 and copy it under the "DB" folder.
